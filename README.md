# Canberra Parks and Population Analysis
---
###  Overview
This project, developed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone, combines geospatial analytics with data science techniques to analyze the distribution of parks and population density in Canberra, Australia. By leveraging geographic data and venue information from the Foursquare API, this project aims to provide insights for urban planning and community development.

### Data Sources
Playgrounds in Canberra: Data regarding playgrounds in Canberra is sourced from the "Town_And_District_Playgrounds.csv" file.
Total Population in Canberra: Population data for each suburb in Canberra is extracted from the "AUS_PPL_2020.csv" file.
Foursquare API: Venue data is collected using the Foursquare API to explore nearby venues in each suburb.

### Working of the Project
- Data Collection: Playground data and population statistics for Canberra suburbs are collected from CSV files. Geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) are obtained for each location.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Geographic visualization techniques are employed to create maps of Canberra, parks, and populated suburbs. This provides an initial understanding of the spatial distribution of key elements.
- Venue Exploration: The Foursquare API is utilized to explore nearby venues in each suburb, focusing on parks and recreational areas. This step provides additional insight into the availability of amenities in different areas.
- Analysis and Insights: Through data analysis, areas with high population density but limited access to parks are identified. Recommendations are made for potential park construction in these areas to improve community well-being and recreational opportunities.
